During a long rest, you may choose to change the damage type.\n\nOn casting, you wreathe your weapon with the element type chosen. You make a melee spell attack with this weapon. On hit, you deal the weapon’s standard damage from its lowest ◉cost attack, up to 4◉, as well as an additional 1d4 damage corresponding to the element damage chosen. You also apply one of the following effects depending on the damage type:\n\n<table><tr><th>Element Type</th><th>Effect</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Acid</td><td>The target’s AC is decreased by 1 (2,3,4) until the start of your next turn.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Cold</td><td>The target’s speed is decreased by 2m (4m, 6m, 8m) until the start of your next turn.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Poison</td><td>Roll an additional 1d4 (2d4, 3d4, 4d4). At the start of the target’s next turn, the target takes poison damage equal to the number rolled.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Fire</td><td>Until the start of your next turn, if the target moves any amount greater than 1m, they take 1d8 (2d8, 3d8, 4d8) fire damage.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Lightning</td><td>Choose 1 (2, 3, 4) creatures adjacent within 2m of the targeted creature. They must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 (2d6, 3d6, 4d6) lightning damage.</td></tr></table>\n\nAt Higher Levels: \nAt 5th level, you use the first value in the bracket instead of the value outside of the brackets, so for example 2d4 instead of 1d4 for poison.\nAt 11th level you use the second value in the bracket, and at 17th you use the third.\n","castingtime":"5◉","concentration":"None","range":"Self","duration":"Instantaneous","componentdesc":"any melee weapon you have equipped"}
