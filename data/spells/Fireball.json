{"schools":["Evocation"],"lists":["Bloodbound","Cleric","Psycaster","Wizard"],"components":["f","v","s"],"level":"0","name":"Fireball","description":"A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a sphere centred on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.\n\nThe spell’s range, radius, and damage can be found on the table below, depending on if this spell is cast as a levelled spell and its level if so.\n\n<table><tr><th>Spell Level</th><th>Range</th><th>Radius</th><th>Damage</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Cantrip</td><td>12m</td><td>2m</td><td>1d8</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1st</td><td>24m</td><td>4m</td><td>4d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2nd</td><td>30m</td><td>6m</td><td>6d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3rd</td><td>60m</td><td>8m</td><td>8d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4th</td><td>60m</td><td>8m</td><td>10d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>5th</td><td>72m</td><td>10m</td><td>10d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>6th</td><td>72m</td><td>10m</td><td>12d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7th</td><td>90m</td><td>12m</td><td>14d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8th</td><td>120m</td><td>12m</td><td>16d6</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9th</td><td>5km</td><td>14m</td><td>18d6</td></tr></table>","castingtime":"5◉","concentration":null,"range":"variable","duration":"Instantaneous","componentdesc":""}
